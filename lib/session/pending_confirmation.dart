// pending_confirmation.dart — durable, workspace-scoped confirmation state
//
// Tracks a confirmation gate (see pipeline/agents/confirmation.dart) across
// the stateless-per-call boundary any consumer (zedup, a future IDE panel)
// dispatches through. Lives alongside handoff.md/skills.md in the workspace
// directory — not local UI state — so every consumer reading the same
// workspace sees the same pending confirmation, durable across restarts.
//
// Deliberately separate from HandoffStatus: workflow phase (suggest vs.
// debug vs. done) and "a confirmation is pending right now" are orthogonal
// axes. Conflating them into one enum would force every consumer parsing
// `## Status` to also guess which axis a value belongs to.
