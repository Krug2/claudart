// step_result.dart — typed result of a single ClaudeRunner call
//
// Was an anonymous record ({String text, Usage usage}). Promoted to a class
// for the same reason StepMode replaced a raw bool: this is a domain object
// (a step's result), not a primitive shape — and Dart records require every
// field to be supplied at every construction site with no optional/default
// support, so a record could never grow new fields (thinking, stopReason,
// durationMs, numTurns) without breaking every existing return statement
// anyway. A class with optional named fields grows without breaking anyone
// who doesn't care about the new fields.
